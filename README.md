# Munajjam

**A Python library and API Server to synchronize Quran ayat with audio recitations.**

Munajjam uses AI-powered speech recognition to automatically generate precise timestamps for each ayah in a Quran audio recording.

## API Server & Docker (Recommended)

You can run Munajjam as a standalone API server with asynchronous processing and GPU support.

### Running with Docker

The easiest way to run the API server is using Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Itqan-community/munajjam.git
cd munajjam

# To run with GPU support (default)
docker compose up --build

# To run with CPU only
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.cpu.yml up --build
```

### API Endpoints

Once the server is running (default: http://localhost:8000), you can use the following endpoints:

- **`POST /align/{surah_number}`**: Upload an audio file for a specific surah. Returns a `job_id`.
  - Form Data: `file` (audio file), `riwaya` (e.g., "hafs")
- **`GET /align/status/{job_id}`**: Check the status of the alignment job and get the results when ready.
- **`GET /health`**: Health check.

## Library Installation

If you want to use Munajjam as a Python library:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Itqan-community/munajjam.git
cd munajjam/munajjam
```

Install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

For faster transcription with [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper):

```bash
pip install ".[faster-whisper]"
```

For development (editable install):

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start (Library)

### 1. Download a sample recitation

Download a sample audio file (Surah Al-Fatiha):

```bash
curl -L -o 001.mp3 "https://pub-9ee413c8af4041c6bd5223d08f5d0f0f.r2.dev/media/uploads/assets/11/recitations/001.mp3"
```

> **Note:** Audio files should be named by surah number (e.g., `001.mp3`, `002.mp3`).
> Browse more recitations at [cms.itqan.dev](https://cms.itqan.dev)

### 2. Run the alignment

```python
from munajjam.core import align
from munajjam.data import load_surah_ayahs
from munajjam.transcription import WhisperTranscriber

# Transcribe audio
with WhisperTranscriber() as transcriber:
    segments = transcriber.transcribe("001.mp3")

# Align to ayahs (uses auto strategy by default; override with "greedy", "dp", or "hybrid")
ayahs = load_surah_ayahs(1)
results = align("001.mp3", segments, ayahs)

# Get timestamps
for result in results:
    print(
        f"Ayah {result.ayah.ayah_number}: "
        f"{result.start_time:.2f}s - {result.end_time:.2f}s"
    )
```

### 3. Output

```text
Ayah 1: 5.62s - 9.57s
Ayah 2: 10.51s - 14.72s
Ayah 3: 15.45s - 18.53s
Ayah 4: 19.21s - 22.54s
Ayah 5: 23.27s - 28.19s
Ayah 6: 29.00s - 33.07s
Ayah 7: 33.98s - 46.44s
```

## Features

- **API Server** - Async FastAPI server for handling concurrent alignment jobs
- **Whisper Transcription** - Uses faster-whisper as default backend with Quran-tuned models
- **FastConformer CTC Alignment** - Optional FastConformer-based CTC alignment path for precise word-level timestamps, with ONNX Runtime inference and support for long-audio chunking
- **Four Alignment Strategies** - Auto, Hybrid, DP, and Greedy
- **Arabic Text Normalization** - Handles diacritics, hamzas, and character variations
- **Automatic Drift Correction** - Multi-pass zone realignment for long recordings
- **Quality Metrics** - Confidence scores for each aligned ayah
- **Phonetic Similarity** - Arabic ASR confusion-aware similarity scoring
- **Word-level Precision** - Uses per-word timestamps (when available) to improve drift recovery

## FastConformer CTC Alignment

Munajjam includes an optional FastConformer CTC alignment path while preserving the existing WhisperX transcription workflow.

The FastConformer path uses CTC emissions for forced alignment and produces word-level timestamps compatible with the existing Munajjam transcription and alignment pipeline.

The implementation supports ONNX Runtime inference and chunked processing for longer audio.

For FastConformer ONNX export, validation, model setup, and troubleshooting, see:

[FastConformer ONNX Validation Guide](./docs/fastconformer-onnx-validation.md)

## Alignment Strategies

The default `auto` strategy works best for most cases. You can override it:

```python
from munajjam.core import Aligner

# Auto (recommended) - picks the best strategy, full pipeline by default
aligner = Aligner("001.mp3")

# Hybrid - DP with greedy fallback (legacy)
aligner = Aligner(
    "001.mp3",  # Audio file path (required)
    strategy="auto",  # "greedy", "dp", "hybrid", or "auto" (default)
    quality_threshold=0.85,  # Similarity threshold for high-quality alignment
    fix_drift=True,  # Run zone realignment for long surahs
    fix_overlaps=True,  # Fix overlapping ayah timings
    min_gap=0.3,  # Minimum gap between consecutive ayahs (seconds)
    energy_snap=True,  # Snap boundaries to energy minima (default True)
)

results = aligner.align(segments, ayahs)
```
